# Fixed-Quantitative

The data covers all of March 2010's anemometer-measured wind speeds at every minute at one of MIT's campus locations ('Sailing Pavilion'). I chose the dataset in part because it's unique (wind is a breath of fresh air), but also that noting wind behavior is pivotal for meteorologists and climate scientists. What I found from the data is that for the first 1000 entries, the mean is 8.258, the median is 8.0, and the standard deviation is 4.692. What this shows is that wind speed has more extreme upper wind speeds than lower, though they typically remain close to the mean. 1000 is too low of a value to be highly descriptive, not to mention that the data is only from one spot on MIT's campus
